# **ProbAtlas3D**

**ProbAtlas3D** is a Python-based application designed for **3D visualization of probability atlases** for any brain region. The application transforms a probability atlas into a **binary image** and utilizes the **Marching Cubes algorithm** to create a 3D mesh. It features a user-friendly **GUI** for interacting with the visualization, allowing users to customize colors, reset the camera, and switch between different files.

---

## **Features**

- **3D Visualization**: Generate interactive 3D representations of brain structures from probability atlases.
- **GUI Interface**: Provides an intuitive GUI to customize the visualization, such as changing colors, resetting the camera, and selecting files.
- **File Selection**: At startup, a custom dialog box prompts users to select files for the **left** and **right brain structures** (e.g., **left substantia nigra** and **right substantia nigra**).

## **File Structure**

Below is the file structure of the **ProbAtlas3D** project, with descriptions of each file:

1. **`Dialogbox.py`**:  
   Handles the custom dialog box that allows users to select the probability atlas files for the **left** and **right brain structures**.

2. **`Loading_and_preprocessing.py`**:  
   Responsible for:
   - Transforming the probability atlas into a **binary image**.
   - Generating a **3D mesh** using the **Marching Cubes algorithm**.

3. **`gui.py`**:  
   Includes the implementation of the **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, which allows users to:
   - Change the color of brain structures.
   - Reset the camera view.
   - Load different files.

4. **`navigator_main.py`**:  
   The main script that initializes and launches the application.

5. **`requirements.txt`**:  
   A list of all Python dependencies required to run the application.

## **Usage Instructions**

1. **Run the Application**:  
   After running the main script, a **custom dialog box** will appear. This dialog will prompt you to select two files:  
   - **Left Structure File**: For example, the left substantia nigra.  
   - **Right Structure File**: For example, the right substantia nigra.  

2. **Visualization**:  
   Once the files are loaded, the **3D visualization** of the brain structures will be displayed.

3. **Interactive GUI Features**:  
   - **Change Colors**: Customize the color of the brain structures.  
   - **Reset Camera**: Reset the camera to its default view.  
   - **Load Different Files**: Use the GUI to load different files and visualize other brain regions.
